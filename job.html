        <h2>Empowering Teachers Across India</h2>
        <p>We are developing a <strong>Teacher Empowerment Portal</strong> to help educators register and create digital profiles that track their <strong>experience, qualifications, and feedback</strong> from schools and parents. Our platform allows teachers to build a verified digital identity and gain visibility across the nation without needing to migrate to cities for job opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Unique Digital Profiles for Teachers</h3>
            <p>Teachers receive a <strong>unique ID</strong> similar to Aadhaar, enabling them to showcase their qualifications and experience to schools across India. With <strong>police verification</strong> and continuous <strong>training</strong>, their profiles provide a transparent view of their capabilities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Rural Access to Quality Teachers</h3>
            <p>Schools in small towns and rural areas can now easily access trained and verified teachers, reducing the need for migration to urban areas. This helps bridge the gap between rural schools and qualified educators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Performance-Linked Incentives</h3>
            <p>Teachers' promotions and incentives are linked directly to <strong>student outcomes, feedback, and satisfaction</strong>, creating a transparent and merit-based system for professional growth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Seamless Onboarding</h3>
            <p>Our platform ensures <strong>real-time job allocation</strong>, continuous <strong>training cycles</strong>, and immediate <strong>feedback loops</strong> for teachers, ensuring they are always improving and ready to meet educational demands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Transparency and Direct Access</h3>
